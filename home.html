            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Started as a passion project by our founder, Kyle, who originaly started watch servicing as a hobby.<br>
                Once he realized the joy and passion he held for watches he wanted to find a way to share that josy and passion with others.<br>
                He first began servicing watches in his spare time in his basement while saving up to open a full time location.<br>
                After a slow start the buisness was finally able to get its legs off the ground and we still gaurantee that same service<br>
                and passion that began the buisness in the first place.</p>
